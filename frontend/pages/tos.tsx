      <h2>Responsibility of Website Visitors</h2>

      <p>
        xmplaylist has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer
        software, posted to the Service, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s
        content, use or effects. By operating the Service, xmplaylist does not represent or imply
        that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be
        accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to
        protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other
        harmful or destructive content. The Service may contain content that is offensive, indecent,
        or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies,
        typographical mistakes, and other errors. The Service may also contain material that
        violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other
        proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject
        to additional terms and conditions, stated or unstated. xmplaylist disclaims any
        responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of the Service, or from any
        downloading by those visitors of content there posted.
      </p>

      <h2>Content Posted on Other Websites</h2>

      <p>
        We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software,
        made available through the websites and webpages to which xmplaylist.com links, and that
        link to xmplaylist.com. xmplaylist does not have any control over those non-xmplaylist
        websites and webpages, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to
        a non-xmplaylist website or webpage, xmplaylist does not represent or imply that it endorses
        such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect
        yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or
        destructive content. xmplaylist disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from
        your use of non-xmplaylist websites and webpages.
      </p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>

      <p>
        This Agreement does not transfer from xmplaylist to you any xmplaylist or third party
        intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property will remain
        (as between the parties) solely with xmplaylist. xmplaylist, xmplaylist.com, the
        xmplaylist.com logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in

        Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. xmplaylist may also, in the future, offer
        new services and/or features through the Service (including, the release of new tools and
        resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions

        You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Service will be in strict accordance with

        state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content,
        and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from
        the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Service will
        not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.
      </p>

      <h2>Indemnification</h2>

      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold harmless xmplaylist, its contractors, and its licensors, and

        including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement.
      </p>

      <h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

      <p>
        This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between xmplaylist and you concerning the
        subject matter hereof, and they may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an
        authorized executive of xmplaylist, or by the posting by xmplaylist of a revised version.
        Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access
        to or use of the Service will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A.,
        excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out
        of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San
        Francisco County, California. Except for claims for injunctive or equitable relief or claims
        regarding intellectual property rights (which may be brought in any competent court without
        the posting of a bond), any dispute arising under this Agreement shall be finally settled in
        accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules of the Judicial Arbitration and
        Mediation Service, Inc. (“JAMS”) by three arbitrators appointed in accordance with such
        Rules. The arbitration shall take place in San Francisco, California, in the English
        language and the arbitral decision may be enforced in any court. The prevailing party in any
        action or proceeding to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to costs and attorneys’
        fees. If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be
        construed to reflect the parties’ original intent, and the remaining portions will remain in
        full force and effect. A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement
        or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any
        subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that
        consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms and conditions; xmplaylist may assign its
        rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will
        inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
